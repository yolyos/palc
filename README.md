# palc - A Unique Command Line Argument Parser ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the **palc** repository! This project is a prototype of a command line argument parser designed with distinct goals that contrast with popular libraries like `clap`. Here, we aim to provide a flexible and intuitive way to handle command line inputs while focusing on simplicity and usability.

## Installation

To get started with **palc**, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/yolyos/palc/releases). Simply download the appropriate file for your operating system and execute it to begin using the parser.

---

## Usage

Using **palc** is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate how you can get started:

```bash
./palc --input file.txt --output result.txt
```

This command specifies an input file and an output file, which **palc** will process according to your defined rules.

---

## Design Goals

**palc** is built with several core design goals in mind:

1. **Simplicity**: We prioritize a clean and understandable interface.
2. **Flexibility**: Users can easily extend the parser to accommodate new argument types.
3. **Performance**: The parser is optimized for speed and efficiency, making it suitable for high-demand applications.

---

## Examples

Here are a few examples to demonstrate how **palc** can be used in various scenarios:

### Basic Argument Parsing

```bash
./palc --name John --age 30
```

This command will accept two arguments: `name` and `age`. The parser will then process these inputs and provide feedback based on the logic you implement.

### Advanced Features

You can also implement flags and optional arguments:

```bash
./palc --verbose --config config.yaml
```

In this case, the `--verbose` flag will trigger detailed output, while the `--config` argument specifies a configuration file.
